This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug: accessing state or props before a component has fully mounted. The bug.js file shows the problematic code, while bugSolution.js presents the corrected version. The issue arises when asynchronous operations (like data fetching) are involved, and the component attempts to use the results before they're available. The solution involves using the component's lifecycle methods effectively to ensure data is available before attempting to use it.
